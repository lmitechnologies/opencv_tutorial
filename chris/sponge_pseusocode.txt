1. create a list of files in the image directory (glob)
2. cycle through the list and load each image
3. convert image to grayscale (opencv)
4. create a thresholding function for each image (opencv)
5. generate a list of contours for each image (opencv)
6. sort the list by area (base python: sorted function)
7. generate a bounding rectangle for the largest contours (opencv)
8. crop the image using the verticies from the bounding rectangle (opencv)
9. save the image (opencv)
